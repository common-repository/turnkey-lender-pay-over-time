## How it works

1. Once you’ve installed and enabled the TurnKey Lender plugin, you need to connect it with your TurnKey Lender solution. Get in touch with our team and we’ll be happy to walk you through the process.
2. TurnKey Lender will automatically calculate the financing options for each product you sell to provide your clients with an instant understanding how what they will need to pay at the time of purchase to get your product.
3. Once your customer fills out the form at the checkout and chooses the Pay overtime option, TurnKey Lender makes a Credit Bureau request and scores the client data to provide personalized financing options automatically.
4. TurnKey Lender takes care of KYC (Know Your Customer) by running identity verifications via the phone number and personal details provided at the checkout.
5. The payment schedule and all the financing details can be changed by you and your staff from the TurnKey Lender software.
